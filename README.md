# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bellabeat Data Analysis

## Overview

This project serves as the Capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certification, focusing on analyzing [Fitbit data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) to derive insights beneficial for Bellabeat, a health and wellness company. By leveraging data from Fitbit users, this analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in health and activity that can inform Bellabeat's product development, while showcasing the range and breadth of skills acquired during my study of the [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) course.


## Objective

The primary objective is to analyze Fitbit fitness tracker data to understand user behavior in terms of physical activity, sleep patterns, and overall health metrics. Insights from this analysis can be used to advise Bellabeat how to enhance its existing products and create new services that align with customers' needs and lifestyle habits.


## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises anonymized data from Fitbit users, including daily activity, sleep records, heart rate, and other health metrics. Key components of the dataset include:

- **dailyActivity_merged.csv**: Daily metrics such as steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutes.
- **sleepDay_merged.csv**: Records of sleep patterns, including total sleep minutes and efficiency.
- **heartrate_seconds_merged.csv**: Heart rate data recorded at second intervals.
- **hourlyCalories_merged.csv**: Hourly calories burned data.
